title: Welcome to my Digital Garden
---

Welcome to my digital garden! This is a space where I share interconnected notes, thoughts, and ideas that grow and evolve over time.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is different from a traditional blog. Instead of finished, polished articles organized by date, a digital garden contains notes at various stages of development. Some are seedlings (early ideas), others are growing, and some are fully cultivated.

## How to Navigate

- **Wiki-links**: Notes link to each other using [[double brackets]]. Click these to explore related ideas.
- **Backlinks**: At the bottom of each note, you'll see what other notes link to the current one.
- **Tags**: Browse by topic using the tags in the sidebar.

## What You'll Find Here

- Technical notes and learnings
- Homelab documentation
- Ideas in progress
- Reference materials

Feel free to explore and discover connections between ideas!
