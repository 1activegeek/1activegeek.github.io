#### The geek ...
I'm a geek with a passion for ... well ... anything technology related really! I've worked in all areas of tech from corporate, security, sales, network, and back. One of the reasons I personally feel successful in my work life, is that my passion outside work lines up with what I do for work. I know you may be thinking, "don't you ever get bored of that stuff?" - the answer is no, not really. There is just so much to learn and I love to learn. Geeking out is tough when most of your friends/family don't quite get it. So I love to bury myself at the computer with a good beer/wine/tequila for the night and drill through setting up something I've never done before. The desire to understand how things work always bring about something new and exciting to discover!

#### The active lifestyle ...
Well that came about in maybe mid 2013. My father was diagnosed with lung cancer. It was a weird time in life for my whole family. Knowing my father had the courage and strength for us - to fight the good fight - I decided to buck it up. I signed up and planned my first year of OCR races (tough mudder, spartan, etc). I had no clue what I was in for, but it sparked a great change in a lot of things. While I had always been "active" this kicked it up a notch. I've learned to live life to the fullest and the active category here will be filled with not only active lifestyle info, but trips, adventures, and knowledge hopefully.

#### If you like what you see ...
Please be sure to get interactive! Like posts, leave comments, share with friends, etc. It'd be great to see this grow into something stronger than just my little space to share the ramblings I've learned about or a record of my&nbsp;adventures to fall back on when I inevitably forget how I did it!
